 * <p>Panels can be closed with {@link #closePanel()}, but also with {@link ModularPanel#closeIfOpen()} and
 * {@link ModularPanel#animateClose()}. With the difference, that the method from this interface also works on server side. </p>
 * Synced panels must be created with {@link PanelSyncManager#panel(String, PanelSyncHandler.IPanelBuilder, boolean)}.
 * If the panel does not contain any synced widgets, a simple panel handler using {@link #simple(ModularPanel, SecondaryPanel.IPanelBuilder, boolean)}
